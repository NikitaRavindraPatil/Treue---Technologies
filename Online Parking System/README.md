In this Project, When the user is not logged in , they can either register or log in.
After logging in , the user can :
1) Check for available parking spaces.
2) Search for available parking spots.
3) View their parking reservations.
4) Log out.

The menu options and actions are structured using a switch-case statement. ANSI color are used for formatting output.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for an online parking system where users can  log in, book parking spots and view their reservation.

I would like to Thank Treue Technologies for giving me this opportunity to implement my skills and knowledge  in the field of Java through these tasks.
